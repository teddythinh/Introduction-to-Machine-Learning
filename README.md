# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the Introduction to Machine Learning course at the University of Science, VNU-HCM.

## Notes

- On week 1, we do not have to write any code. We just need to read the slides and answer the questions.
- On week 2, we have to write code in Python. I use Jupyter Notebook to write code so you should open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook
