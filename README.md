# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the Introduction to Machine Learning course at the University of Science, VNU-HCM.

## Notes

- On week 1, we do not have to write any code. We just need to read the slides and answer the questions.
- From week 2, I use Jupyter Notebook to write code so you should open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab or Google Colab.
- I'm using Miniconda to manage the environment. You can install miniconda from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

## Environment

- File `min_ml-env.yml` is the environment file. You can use it to create a new environment for this course

Run this command to create a new environment from the file:

``` bash
conda env create --file min_ml-env.yml
```

After installing all the packages, run this command to activate the environment:

``` bash
conda activate min_ml-env
```
